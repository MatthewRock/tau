countess margit and her cousin the baron waldis-schwartzenberg
" margit , why do you keep postponing our wedding date ?
" you know it is your father's dearest wish to see our families united "
" my dear cousin , i will obey my father's wishes , but i do not love you "
" look !
the horse is going towards the lake ! "
" take this locket with my portrait on it , as a keepsake "
" i am grateful for life for saving my daughter's life "
the next day
" i could be famous like balduin , the best swordsman , but , my real enemy is the reflection of my own image "
balduin decides to visit the countess
" may i ask , how does the countess feel today ? "
" balduin , let me introduce you to the baron waldis-schwartzenberg , the future husband of my daughter "
balduin , who is just a poor student , takes his leave
" all she says is " thank you " , the rich heiress and me just a poor student "
" how did you get in ? "
" through the door ! "
" now , misternot only are you the best swordsman and the most courageous , but on top of that "
" the most rich ! ! "
" what is the bargain ? "
i certify , i was paid 100000 golden coins , for giving scapinelli the right to take anything that pleases him from this room
balduin , prague , may 13th of 1820
" what a weird guy !
anything from this little room ! "
" take whatever you want ! "
i certify , i was paid 100000 golden coins , for giving scapinelli the right to take anything that pleases him from this room
balduin , prague , may 13th of 1820
" so do choose whatever you like ! "
" mister balduin

" what did you say ?
my reflection ? "
" nevermind , a contract is a contract ! "
a new life started for balduin
" we are invited to the governor's party "
" dear countess , do allow me ? "
" at last , fate lets us be alone for a while "
" margiti love you ! "
" that is impossible "
lyduschka follows the couple
" goodbye , balduin "
" am i awake or dreaming ?
who are you ? "
" is there any problem , my friend ?
you look pale , don't you feel good ? "
" lookwhat you look like on the mirror "
" my dear cousin , do not forget that we are engaged "
balduin is waiting for the count's carriage
the countess , in her bedroom
" yes , balduin , my heart belongs to you ! "
dear countess , please , i beg you to keep your promess to meet tomorrow afternoon , in the usual place
lyduschka is looking for the countess
countess margit is leaving for her date
" wait !
if you go to that meeting you'll be in great danger "
" what does this gypsy want of me ? "
margit tries to gain courage by going to the " sacred fountain "
margit , on the thought of the gypsy's warning , prays god
" why did you choose this place ? "
" my dear countess , for the quietness , the peace , the solitude "
" who is he ? "
" dear baron i believe the countess has lost her handkerchief "
" how dare you act like that with my fiancée ? "
balduin , still worried by what happened , returns home
" what brings you here , baron ? "
" i don't want to talk
you have tainted my family's honor i am at your disposal "
balduin's representatives talk with the baron and organize the duel
" baron , have you chosen yet sword or gun ? "
" what do you say ?
sword ?
but isn't balduin the best swordsman in prague ? "
" what are you doing here , count ? "
" i want your word that you will not kill the baron
he is the only son of my sister , and the future husband of my daughter , he is my heir and the last one to carry our name "
" i give you my word , count ! "
balduin goes to the duel
" where do you go ? "
the promess he gave to the count has been broken by his other self
balduin wants to explain the baron's death
" the baron's family has nothing to say to mister balduin ! "
balduin tries to forget his love
" it's your love i want , not your money ! "
" do you want to play cards with me ? "
" what do we bargain ? "
" one of us ! "
and wherever i'll die and rest , there will always be , by my side , a strange man , dressed in black , like a monk
" i have to meet her !
i have to try to explain it to her "
" countess , it wasn't my fault ! "
" forgive me , do not hold this grudge ! "
" balduin , where is your reflection ? "
" say whatever you like , what gives you the right to persecute me ? "
i am not god , nor the devil either , but with spite i pronounce your name !
so that wherever you are , i will be too
balduin runs away as if he had seen the devil
" he still follows me ! "
" scapinelli , take your money back ! "
" i still feel his presence ! "
" i will get rid of you , once and for all
i will kill you with my gun !
" i am saved ! "
" bloodi am hurt ! "
i certify , i was paid 100000 golden coins , for giving scapinelli the right to take anything that pleases him from this room
balduin , prague , may 13th of 1820
i am not god , nor the devil either , but with spite i pronounce your name !
so that wherever you are , i will be too and on your final hour , in front of your tombstone , i will seat on your grave
here lays balduin

subs federico1921/ektinar
in the great gold rush , alaska was the hope and dream of men , the ruthless siren of the far north , beckoning thousands to her icy bosom
beckoning thousands to her unknown regions
chilkoot pass was the great barrier to the gold fields over this pass men faced untold misery and hardship
many lost their lives some fell by the wayside , others lost courage and turned back but the brave went on
far into the icy north , deep into the silent nowhere , came an undaunted lone prospector
and somewhere in that nowhere was another lone prospector
with cheerful optimism our little columbus descended , then stopped , stepped , slipped and slid
" now let me see , " thought the little fellow
" before i know where i am , i must get there "
there in that frozen wilderness a dream came true , and a lone voice shrieked into the solemn sky ,
" eureka !
i've found it , a mountain of gold ! "
but the elements laughed , roared and thundered
in that raging nowhere was a lone cabin , and another lone man , black larson , an unmitigated , predatory scoundrel
out of the lashing storm came the little fellow to find shelter and perhaps a little hospitality
there he sat , resting his weary bones as the icy wind howled through the knothole
" come here , " said larson
" what are you doing ? "
" eating , obviously "
" get out "
" go on ! "
" get out ! "
the wind also was giving big jim his troubles
big jim was the noble type he had suffered
oh , how he loved to suffer he suffered about everything
" get out , " said black larson
" or i'll fill you both full of lead "
" now then , the pair of you , get out ! "
" out ! "
that kind of noise jim don't tolerate
" i'll stay right here , understand ? "
" right here , " said big jim
" yes , sir , he'll stay right here , " said the little fellow
" understand ?
we stay right here "
and stay they did , for days and nights the cabin moaned and groaned
two men walked and never talked , hunger gnawed their bones
" i must have food ! " yelled big jim
" i must have food ! "
" what are you eating ? " said black larson
" nothing "
" open your mouth ! "
" liar ! it's that candle "
" that ? " said the little fellow
" how revolting "
" if i thought you were holding out on me , i'd slit your gizzard ! "
" one of us must brave that storm , if we're to get food "
" come here , the pair of you "
" we'll cut the cards and the low man goes "
" you're the man , " said jim
" goodbye , good luck "
" don't forget to bring home the bacon "
somewhere in that nowhere , the law was looking for black larson
desperate with hunger and here it was thanksgiving day
nevertheless there was something to be thankful for
" not quite done yet , give it two more minutes "
" come on , come on , " said big jim
after scouring the country for food , the little fellow had to admit he had seen nothing , not even a field mouse
from the pangs of hunger , big jim was becoming delirious , hysterical
in fact he was a pain in the neck
" food , food ! " he thundered
" i can put another shoe in the pot "
" no , no , anything but that ! "
poor jim , he couldn't take it
" what's the matter ? " said the little fellow
" i thought you were a chicken "
" well , build up the fire , " said big jim
" what's the matter with you ? " said the little fellow
" come , my pretty bird , " said big jim
" don't be childish "
" hey , quit it
don't be foolish , it's me ! "
" you ! " said jim
" i'm sorry i must be crazy "
" you're telling me , " said the little fellow
" you go inside i'll take the gun in case you lose it "
chicken or no chicken , the little fellow looks appetizing to big jim
meanwhile black larson stumbled onto big jim's mountain of gold
then came the parting of the ways ,
big jim to his mine , our hero to his fate
" goodbye , " said the little fellow
" it's been a great pleasure knowing you "
treachery awaited big jim at his mountain of gold
big jim looked deep into the eyes of black larson and saw there the soul of a skunk
caught in a maelstrom of desperate deeds ,
black larson swept on to impending doom
and out of a dream in that frozen waste , a city grew
and humanity warmed it with living , loving and desiring
georgia
jack was a ladies' man
georgia was quick and impulsive , proud and independent
in the evening georgia worked as a dancehall girl
jack had lots of appeal for georgia
perhaps that's why she resented him
out of the night came the little fellow , towards the dancehall , that beacon light of pleasure , that retreat of lost dreams
" georgia , why aren't you nice to jack ? "
" i believe he really likes you , " said the girl
" he likes everybody , " said georgia quite audibly
" i'm bored with this place , " she continued
" i'd give it all up if i could find someone honest and worthwhile "
" don't worry , i'll find him someday "
then she turned and looked and looked and looked
" kinda fresh , ain't ya ? " thought jack
" get down off that high horse "
" me and you are gonna dance "
" hey there , pan out a tune "
" just a moment , i said we're gonna dance "
" i beg your pardon , " said georgia
to show her utter contempt for jack , she picked out the most deplorable looking tramp in the dancehall
" hey you , come here "
" yes , you
do you want to dance ? "
" you see , i'm very particular about whom i dance with "
and there he stood , the dauntless cavalier , guarding her sanctuary
" if you wanna make a hit with your lady friend , "
" you should put your hat on straight , like this ! "
" take that you ouch ! "
" huh ! very good "
" didn't know me own strength , " said the little fellow
hank curtis' cabin was a stone's throw from the dancehall
hank was a mining engineer who lived alone and occasionally went on long expeditions into the far north
hank was kind and human , and our hero cold and hungry , and the beans smelled good and the coffee was steaming hot
so the little fellow devised a way of getting breakfast
big jim recovered from the blow he received from black larson but lost his memory
hank's partner arrives
both are ready to leave on a long expedition
hank informs his partner that the little fellow is to look after the cabin while he's away
" goodbye , " said hank
" and don't forget to feed the mule "
since that night in the dancehall the little fellow hadn't seen georgia , but an incident was to bring them together again
there she stood , her loveliness lighting the room , filling his soul with the music of romance for which he was so ill-fitted
as she introduced her friends , his heart began to sing
as they warmed up by the stove , he excused himself to get firewood
and in that cabin his secret was revealed , his love for georgia
and the girls giggled and laughed , perhaps in order to hide their pity
for in the world of the dancehall it wasn't wise for the girls to reveal their hearts
and so they thought they'd have a little fun with him
there in the gloaming they sat , their faces alight with mischief , but all the while his heart was singing
and so she fooled and flirted and stroked his hair
he knew she was fooling , but he was happy for she was near him , holding his hand , smiling at him
" nice place you have here , " said georgia
" i hope you will invite us again "
what if she were fooling ?
he was enjoying the warmth of her attention and the lady was enjoying the warmth of his chair
and now she was leaving
the light of her loveliness would be gone and he would be left with an emptiness , to return to his bleak , lonely existence
" pardon me , " said the little fellow , " but , uh " he was lost for words
" would you really like to come again ? "
" of course , " said georgia
" what do you say , girls ? "
" we'll come for dinner new year's eve , " said the ladies
" very well , " said georgia
" we'll come to dinner new year's eve "
of course at that moment georgia would forget her gloves !
for the next few days the little fellow hustled and shoveled in order to buy that new year's dinner
the eve of a new year
new hopes and new dreams
and there was georgia , caressing him with her smiles and tender glances
and the girls called for a speech
but he was too happy to speak
all that mattered was georgia was there
georgia !
so he muttered and stuttered and finally said ,
" i can't make a speech but i'll do a dance "
and a dance he did , with the rolls
in the midst of all their revelry the vague memory of a promise crept into georgia's mind
" let's go up and visit the little fellow , " she said
" we'll have some fun with him , " said jack
" we'll send georgia in first , then give him a scare "
" oh , forget it , " said jack
" how about giving me a little attention ? "
a day or so later in the recorder's office , big jim tried to convince the assayers that he had a mountain of gold
" where is this place ? " they said
but big jim's memory had failed him
all he knew was that it was near the cabin
" the cabin , that's it ! "
" f i could find my way to the cabin i could find the mine "
" but i can't remember "
" hey ! " said jack , " georgia's been looking for you "
the little fellow knew otherwise
how dare that cad mention her name so lightly ?
for two pins he'd give him another thrashing however being a little underweight he would ignore the insult
but it was true georgia had been looking for him
georgia had written him a letter
and as he went looking for georgia , so big jim went looking for him
" you , you ! " said big jim
" you ! the very man i've been looking for ! "
" the cabin , the cabin !
where is it ? "
" answer me , i say ! "
" can't you speak , man ? tell me ! "
" where's the cabin ?
where is it ? "
" at last i shall find my mountain of gold "
" to your feet man , quick ! "
" you're coming with me ! "
" take me to the cabin and i'll make you a millionaire ! "
" georgia ! just a moment , " said the little fellow
" georgia , you don't have to explain i understand "
" i love you i'll take you away from this life "
" i'm going away , and when i return , " " i shall come back "
exhausted and footweary , they arrived at the cabin
" ah ! " said big jim , " it won't be long now "
" bring in the eats and tomorrow we'll start for the mine
" here , take a swig of this it'll put hair on your topcoat "
" my , this is a heavy lamb chop , " said the little fellow
then fate - it's always fate - played its little joke , and again the elements laughed , roared and thundered , but through it all our heroes soundly slumbered
then came the dawn
the little fellow awoke , blissfully ignorant of what happened the night before , but feeling definitely conscious of " the morning after "
" oh well , may as well tidy up and get breakfast "
" this is the worst liver attack i've ever had "
" feel that rocking ? "
" it's the stomach "
" it's not the stomach "
" let's go to the other side "
" we'll see how far it will go over "
" something must be missing underneath "
" i'll go outside and see what it is "
" now , " said big jim , " don't get excited "
" take it easy , don't move , don't breathe ! "
" i said don't breathe , stupid "
" you can be most annoying at times "
" if you'll only be cool , be calm , " said big jim ,
" we have nothing to worry about "
" now show a little character ! where's your willpower ? "
" now listen , i've got a very good idea "
" hold your hands like this , then i can get out first "
" you see what i mean ? " said big jim
" your mind is chaotic you have no psychology "
" you have no control "
and big jim discovered his claim !
" now we shall be rich , " said jim
" we shall be millionaires ! "
and so they were
now they were homeward bound and they were leaving the hardship and toil of alaska to live in the land of milk and honey to live , laugh and indulge themselves in the lap of luxury
they were famous , and sought after by the press
in their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon
the reporter wanted to write the little fellow's life story ,
" from rags to riches " , and he graciously consented
and big jim was manicured
" not the nails , " said he , " the corns "
the reporter thought of a good idea , to have the little fellow pose in his mining clothes it would make a human story
georgia
there she was in the steerage neither knew of the other's presence
georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard
" you ! " said georgia
" i thought i'd never see you again "
and then she mistook him for the stowaway
the officer was going to put him in irons but georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare
" heck ! " said the captain " that's no stowaway "
" that's big jim's partner , the multimillionaire "
then of course there were apologies
the little fellow gathered himself together james , the valet , was told to prepare for an extra guest
" pardon me , " said the reporter , " but who's the lady ? "
" buzz buzz buzz ! "
" oh , you don't say !
well , congratulations "
" this will make a great story , and with a happy ending " and so it was
a happy ending

for decades the lost world could be seen only in an abridged version about an hour in length
this edition combines portions of eight prints to present the most complete reconstruction believed possible
sir arthur conan doyle's stupendous story of adventure and romance
the lost world
by arrangement with watterson r rothacker
introducting sir arthur conan doyle , author of the story
i have wrought my simple plan if i give one hour of joy to the boy who's half a man or the man who's half a boy
london
i have a presentiment that you are going to propose , ed
i do wish you wouldn't , for this are so much nicer as they are
but why can't you love me , gladys ?
now tell me what's amiss with me
i will only marry a man of great deeds and strange experiences
- a man who can look death in the face without flinching !
in the office of the london-record journal
i want your legal advice
profesor challenger threatens to sue my paper for doubting his yarn about live dinosaurs
famous zoologlsts returns from south amerlca wlthouth proofs of strange tale
profesor challenger , well-known author and scientist , has returned to london with a strange tale of mammoths , pterodoctyls and other prehistoric monsters roaming at large somewhere on the upper reaches of the amazon
unfortunately for the professor's reputation for veracity , he refuses to give the exact location of his alleged discoveries , and still more unfortunately , the photographs in his possession are so badly damaged (when the professor's canoe is said to have been overturned) that they certainly cannot be acepted as evidence in this case
i believe challenger is insane !
he nearly killed three reporters i sent to interview him today !
mr mcardle , couldn't you send me on a dangerous assignment ?
all i need is an opportunity -
you seem very anxious to lose your life !
have you been interviewing challenger , malone ?
don't apologize - hurry over to zoological hall and cover challenger's lecture
reporters are barred - but get in !
there's sir john roxton - famous hunter and explorer
he's here to check up on challenger's cock-and-bull story
well , malone , we're in for a lively session tonight - the students are out in force to heckle old challenger
challenger has made himself a public laughing - stock by his tale about live dinosaurs !
what can he hope to gain by such lies ?
the back country of the amazon contains over fifty thousand miles of unexplored water-ways
who can say what may be living in that jungle - as vast as all europe ?
but how can challenger's story be true ?
these creatures have all been dead ten million years !
you might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case
reporters are barred- if i show my press pass i'll get kicked out
gladly - i'll take you in on my pass
that's profesor summerlee , the eminent coleopterist
- owing to lack of proofs , this society cannot sponsor profesor challenger's statement , but is glad to afford him this opportunity to state his case , and , we trust , clear his name
bring on your mastodons !
bring on your mammoths !
i will - if any of you spineless worms are brave enough to go back with me into the trackless jungles where these monsters live !
i told you old challenger is sincere !
and i'm not here tonight to defend my statements - but to demand that a committee be formed to go back to the lost world with me -
looks like a riot it's a beastly shame !
when dealing with undeveloped minds , it is useless to appeal to reason - for they have none !
i am calling for volunteers !
volunteers to face death - or worse - for the sake of science
i am sixty-seven years of age - but , because i think you are a liar and a fraud - i accept your challenge , sir !
accepted !
better an old fool - than a young coward !
i'm neither a student nor a scientist - but i'd like to be counted in on this !
my friend , sir john roxton !
accepted !
your record as a hunter of big game will add weight to your testimony - if we return !
professor challenger , i'd like to go on this expedition !
probably the brain of a child - but the body of an athlete
accepted
what is your name ?
edward e malone -
and your occupation ?
i- i'm a-a-er-a reporter , sir london-record journal
take me home - i've had enough of this !
eleven enmore park , kensington , west !
professor challenger , i've got to go on this expedition !
the girl i'm engaged to won't marry me until i've faced death or -
this man attacked me !
do you give him in charge , sir ?
no i was to blame
i intruded upon him
now , sir , can't we talk this expedition over sanely ?
sir john roxton is a friend of mine-
why didn't you mention that before ?
you've hurt another nice young man !
i saw you from the dining room window !
if my husband gets abusive again - just call me !
you betrayed a glimmer of intelligence just now while talking to the policeman-
sit down !
do you want to join this expedition because you believe my statements are true ?
austin !
tell miss white i wish to see her at once !
have you shown malone - the diary ?
property of maple white ?
brontosaurus
miss paula white - daughter of poor maple white - the unfortunate explorer whose notebook you hold in your hands
miss white was her father's trained assistant
she will tell you why she came to me
i was in camp with jungle fever when my father went up to explore that terrible plateau
carnivorous beast allosaurus
evidently already almost externet even lea for i saw few of they
a living brontosaurus
you mean that you actually saw living descendants of these monsters that are supposed to have been dead for millions of years ?
yes , they were tremendous in size and ferocity
our bearers were so terrified they deserted- carrying me back to the coast - leaving my father marooned up there - with those beasts -
he would go - in spite of what we had - seen
my husband promised to raise funds for a rescue party - but instead of getting people to help him , he throws them out of windows and things !
why , this is a great human interest story -
and even if my paper was not convinced of the scientific value of your statements - it might finance a rescue party provided that the exclusive publication rights-
i'll swear not to send an article back to my paper without your full approval , sir !
if sir john roxton will go with me - i believe we can make my managing editor see this thing !
i'm sure you know why i am going on this rescue party , paula - don't you ?

i will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of our voyage
eventually we found ourselves in that no-man's-land which is formed by the half-defined frontiers between peru , brazil and colombia
the sealed map we promised challenger to not open untill we arrived here is only a blank page
excepting a miracle , our expedition seems to have come to a premature end
may i come in ?
from henceforth i take command of this expedition
let it be clear that you are all perfectly helpless without me !
if that mischievious beast is to go with us , i remain behind !
jocko knows which berries and roots in the forest are edible , and which are poisonous - he will be far more use to us than you , my dear sir !
record
explorers reach last outpost of clvillzatlon
record-journal party searching for lost scientist to make way into mystery world via secret rivers
may not be heard from agaln for months
it's a brazilian sloth - they always walk head downward
see the baby clinging to her ?
dear mr mcardle :
it is three weeks since we sent back the canoes and tonight we are camping at the base of the great plateau upon which maple white was marooned
challenger has guided us to this spot , and proven that the plateau is a fact - but we have no reason to believe that any monsters are roaming about up there in fact , i don't think
they're not cubs - but full grown " spectacle bears " - great camp followers
paula says her father felled one of the trees on that pinnacle so that it dropped across the chasm and made a bridge
you can still see the stump of the old tree
in the morning we'll climb the pinnacle - and drop the other tree over
a pterodactyl - proving definitely that the statements in poor maple white's diary are true !
a brontosaurus - feeding merely on leaves
perfectly harmless - unless it happens to step on us
who would believe this !
my elephant gun might as well be a bean-shooter !
great guns !
we can't get back !
we're prisoners - exactly like maple white !
that means our folk are still alive !
what are you thinking of , paula - in this lost world of ours ?
i was thinking if my father were still alive - he would have seen our fire
- and come to us
an allosaurus - a meat-eater - the most vicious pest of the ancient world
the barrier might as well thistle-down - and fire may not work with the next one
- we've got to find a safe camp !
jocko will be mighty lonesome down here without miss paula - he climbed that big rock this morning to get to her - he can't bear that girl out of his sight !
i have an idea !
after supper bring all those hammocks into the tent !
we must establish camp here - our only refuge from these monsters - if we'll live long enough to search for your father
now that we've found these caves we could live here the rest of our lives - if we had some weapon capable of making a dent in a dinosaur !
i am now inventing such a weapon
we can't rest until every inch of this plateau is explored !
it's miles in length - your father may have found other caves -
when i release the tree it will snap back with terrific force - and by calculating the curve the rock will describe as it rushes through the air-
a curve ?
nonsense !
any school boy could tell you the rock will describe a parabola
a curve !
a parabola !
i was right - you described a curve !
we'll work all night and make enough ladder to get you in the morning
fine !
but how in thunder do you expect to get it up to us ?
bring miss paula to call jocko - he'll climb anything to get to her !
there's only a small cave above this - but your father must be somewhere on the plateau
do you mean we are to be here - always ?
what difference does it make where we are paula - so long as we are - together ?
but your engagement to - gadys ?
paula , dear , we're as cut off from the world and its obligations and promises as if we were on the moon
i'm going to ask professor summerlee to marry us
you know he used to be a minister
go hunt up the professors - i have something to - tell paula-
a lovely specimen !
we'll stalk it and observe its habits !
that dormant volcano is waking !
the whole plateau will be covered in lava !
but this has been going on for hours - i'm afraid they're lost -
if they get back we must be here to show them the way to the tunnel opening
it's their only hope of escape !
the professors and mr malone are safe - they'll be here in a minute or two !
i certainly hope that mud holds !
we're back in the world - and its obligations
why should we let gladys rob us of happiness , paula ?
i can't steal my happiness from another woman
i'm major hibbard , of the brazilian geodetic survey
yesterday i saw a cloud of smoke over the plateau -
and we smoked out quite a rat , major !
i'd give my entrie personal fortune to get that beast to london - alive !
i'll send for men to dredge out this stream - built a steel cage and a raft - and when the big rains come next month , we might float your " rat " out !
if we once could get our raft as far as the amazon , you could charter a steamer from there !
later - in london
tonight you will not jeer - for i have brought back a living proof of my statements !
may i ask what you mean when you say " proof " , professor challenger ?
a living brontosaurus - nearly sixty feet long from the nose to the tip of the tail !
mr edward malone , through whose efforts this expedition , was financed , is now superintending the unloading of the monster from the ship we chartered-
the message i have been expecting has come !
i'll inform you in a moment when and where the brontosaurus will be on view !
as we swung the cage out over the dock the cables broke-
the fall smashed the cage - and it got out !
it's running wild - the streets are in an uproar !
my brontosaurus has escaped !
keep off the streets , untill i recapture it !
this is outrage - we've been hoaxed again -
challenger should be run out of town !
how d'ydo , gladys
you see i'm - back
and , as you really owe it all to me , i hope you'll forgive me - for not waiting
my husband , percy potts
may i ask what great stunt , what heroic deed mr potts performed - to win you , gladys ?
that was just my girlish whim !
percy is a clerk at a store , and has never been out of london in his life !
excuse me !
she didn't wait for me - she's married !
that's sir john roxton - sportsman
every epoch dreams its successor
--jules michelet
at this moment our state extends its reach to the stars !
i tremble at the honor of announcing the culmination of humanity's long history of intellect and science
our power spans the earth now it will illuminate the stars !
may it stand forever !
our ziggurat !
those robots are getting big ideas
they don't know their place !
but our economy is unthinkable without robot labor
yes , but they cause friction with human workers
the enemy is developing new weapons
what metropolis needs is a leader who will be a powerful symbol !
duke red , with the ziggurat complete , will you be entering politics ?
don't be silly !
as long as president boone governs , our state is secure
politics has no need of me
mr president , would you like to see duke red in politics ?
don't encourage him !
how could i compete with anyone so popular ?
it is true there are military facilities in the ziggurat ?
would the mayor care to comment ?
ask minister of state skunk about that
hurray for the ziggurat ! long live metropolis !
hurray for the ziggurat ! long live metropolis !
uncle shunsakuwhat does 'ziggurat' mean ?
who knows ?
hey ! look up there !
what's that ?
malduk !
it's the malduks !
there he is !
you said she'd be ready tonight , dr laughton
er , well what is the meaning of this ? i've given you the best facilities money can buy !
if you could wait a little longer
i'm almost done
i'm tired of hearing that
i'll be at your lab tomorrow night
but it's not the kind of place you'd go to !
and the place is a mess !
get back to work !
it's me
i hear there was trouble , rock
yes a robot agitator in the plaza
you were supposed to have that under control !
yes , father
fool !
i am not your father !
i merely found you during the last war and took you in
yes , sir
i'm shunsaku ban , a private investigator from japan
i have a letter of introduction to superintendent notarlin
i see
so you're saying this 'dr laughton' is hiding out here in metropolis ?
yes
this is a reliable tip from an organ smuggler he dealt with
the international human rights committee and other organizations have issued warrants against him for vivisection experiments and dealing in human organs
to which end i ask for your cooperation seeing i've never been in this city and i don't know east from west here
i'd like to help , but with the celebrations for the ziggurat going on all this week it's taking every single person i have to keep things under control
i don't have anybody
well , i could give you a robot if that's okwith you
a robot ? !
yes
he's very good
he's not authorized to arrest people but he can certainly assist you in your investigation
do i have to return him with a full tank ?
he only needs refueling every five years
soon they won't need us any more
i'm ken-ichi
how do you do
i am model 803-d-rp-dm 497-3-c
uh , how do you do
the completion of the ziggurat establishes our metropolis as the world leader in industry , economics and culture
thus is born a state that will last a thousand years !
i tremble at the honor of announcing the culmination of humanity' long history of intellect and science
our power spans the earth now it will illuminate the stars !
may it stand forever !
our ziggurat !
well , where do we start , uh 803 , uh
'd-rp-dm497-3-c'
don't you have an easier name ?
we are not allowed human names , as it may infringe upon human rights
i know !
as of now , your name is 'pero'
that's a dog's name !
that's right i used to have a dog named 'pero'
he was a great dog
in my opinion , a criminal could not hide up here in metropolis
i have reliable sources that say he's here !
dr laughton would not hide up here he would go to zone 1
'zone 1' ?
underground hey !
you are a detective !
it is simply a calculation of probabilities
robots are strictly forbidden to operate outside their assigned area
that robot was not authorized to operate at surface level
ok , but who are those guys ? they look like fascists
the malduk party , vigilantes who started as a political group
movement between levels is restricted
no one who carries the mark may pass through this gate
so that robot had the mark ?
yes
each block has a gate like this there are , of course , hidden ways and people who work as guides to them
damn right ! the system's wrong !
hmmit takes light to create shadow , i guess
this level is not particularly dangerous but there are places in which police writ does not run avoid them
we can't do that
we're not here as tourists
duke red
let's see it
very good
isn't she finished ?
her final-stage energy processor isn't stable yet
are you using real organs ?
dear me , no !
that's illegal !
real organs are quicker , but they don't last very long
hers are mechanical i made them
she will be my masterpiece !
when will you finish ?
within the week
if i start her too early she'll build up too much energy , catch fire and explode
my tima
i'm not giving you to anyone !
i'll put on the finishing touches and together we will flee !
rock ?
what are you doing here ?
protecting my father is my most important task
'father' ?
but duke red has no children
and the child who died was a girl
quiet !
i know what you're up to
no mad scientist is going to deceive my father
and no mannequin like this will steal his heart
stop !
it is at duke red's request i've made tima
tima is the super-being who is to sit on the throne of power atop the ziggurat
you lie !
he would never give the ziggurat to a robot !
perhaps you should ask duke red about that
will you destroy the super-being for whom the one you call 'father' waits ?
no robot will steal my father !
no !
don't !
o ye gods , give me courage and strength to guard my father from machines !
fire !
fire !
a malduk set that fire !
i saw him !
the ones up there want to kill us !
atlas is right !
they think we're nothing but garbage !
to arms !
now we have to fight !
please remain calm
fire-fighting operations are commencing
everyone please step back
robots out !
first you take our jobs , and now you're trying to kill us !
this is no time to be fighting !
what the ? !
but why did he set fire to that old factory ?
well , that strange old man was around
an old man ? this one ?
yes
thanks a lot !
there's someone in there !
uh-oh
ken-ichi , go round the back
hurry !
come on , laughton !
n-n-notebook
that notebook ?
laughton !
laughton's lab burned down ? !
i guess he was doing an experiment
the fire just ripped right through it
what happened to him ?
his body was found
whatever he was doing considering there are warrants for his arrest it must have been something dangerous
what's wrong , father ?
what did dr laughton mean to you ?
get out !
leave me alone
where am i ?
that was sure some fire !
well , it was just an old factory
saves the trouble of tearing it down
this is strange
she was the most advanced robot there is
there should be something left
pero , who's that ?
rock of the malduks
he's young , but he's one of their main men
they say he does duke red's dirty work
duke red ?
is he connected with the malduks ?
he's the party founder
now there's no official connection , but he funds their activities
it's a public secret everyone knows
where does this sewer come out ?
it merges up ahead with the sewage from zone 2 and goes to the processing plant in zone 3
if she's down there she'll have been chopped up with the other garbage
anyone else , yes the criminal always returns to the scene
an old saying , but a good one
we should continue searching for ken-ichi
who are you ?
'who are you'
no , no , noyou call yourself 'i'
'i' am who ?
'i am'
you are i
nolisten
'you' are 'i'
'i' am 'you'
huh ?
i am who
yeah , that's right
and i'm ken-ichi
'ken-ichi'
'ken-ichi'
anyway , it'll all come to you after a while
your name , your family , your father , your mother
'family''father'
uh , thanks , i guess
i know this is food , but it's all rotten
'food'
yeah you put it in your mouth like thisand eat it
no , don't eat that !
it'll make you sick !
'no , don't eatmake you sick'
commencing cooling opening dome
40 seconds to radiation39 , 38
motor , cooling , sensor and operating systems , all 'go'
commencing final preparations
magnetic target : bias 025
radiation equipment in position
we'll radiate for three minutes
citizens won't be affected , but above-ground robots will
i'm having everything recorded
the data will be valuable
begin at level 3
yes , doctor
commencing radiation !
five seconds to sector r 432 1
omotanium fusion !
omotanium confirmed in fraunhoffer phase
35 , 00040 , 00045 , 000
sunspot field density 800 and rising
ionospheric disturbance communications disrupted
level-3 radiation terminated
control disengaged
success !
this will set the whole world on its ear !
you now hold the power of the gods themselves
if only dr laughton had finished building our guardian deity
he's caused anomalies in sunspots and bathed earth in harmful magnetic radiation
it's an outrage that he would endanger national security by developing such a thing !
the malduk robot hunters are using this as an excuse to cry 'human rights' and press for changes in the robot law
the pro-robot citizens' groups say that's reactionary nonsense they're organizing protests there's fighting breaking out
this is our chance , mr president !
we could make a case for treason here
will the military support us ?
some units are under duke red's influence , but i can handle that
we'll stir up the public with a few leaks
once sentiment is against duke red , we'll arrest him for treason
should military action be needed , you have my approval
i suspect he was the guy who did in laughton
what i don't understand is how they were connected
just what was laughton working on , anyway ?
what will you do ?
laughton's already dead i want at least to know why
my client deserves that
where's he going now ?
zone 2 , i think
there's another level below this ?
how far down does this place go ?
zone 2 is the metropolis power-plant area
zone 3 below that is the sewage-handling facility
the sewage facility
you know , he was looking at a drain behind that factory
i'll report back and get permission to go below
i'll file a missing-persons report on ken-ichi , too
hey !
you're kind of old for a petty thie !
sorry !
if anyone was wandering around down there they'd notice him right away
how often are you down here ?
twice a week , for maintenance on the robots
these are albert ii types
it's their last check this week
is anyone here ?
you never get used to the stink down here , though
no human could last a day at this work
what is it ?
someone's there
impossible !
hey ! what are you doing there ? !
this is a restricted area !
so she survived
help !
what are you doing ? !
it's all right
they're criminals
how do we get out of here ?
stop that , please !
you'll hit the equipment !
are you ok ?
that guy's trying to kill us !
move !
move ! out of the way !
you piece of junk !
move !
is it safe ?
it looks ok
what's wrong ?
oh , i get it fifi can't go through that gate
thanks for everything , fifi
we'll see you again
move !
it's him !
no weapons through here may i see your i d ?
i'm rock of the malduks !
demonstrations are forbidden during celebration week
please disperse immediately
ken-ichi ?
ken-ichi ?
hey !
pay up !
they're not here !
they have to be ! keep looking !
look over that way !
what's the matter , atlas ?
we're waiting for your signal !
not today
there are malduks all over the place
was there a leak ?
they're the reason
rock's after them
come on !
he was at that factory
who are you ?
where did you come from ?
i'm ken-ichi
i'm from japan my uncle's a private
a private what ?
uha journalist ! i'm his assistant
why is rock after you ?
i don't know
he just started shooting at us
i don't trust them
let's kill them
cool it !
we're not a gang
he says he's a journalist
if he can tell the world about metropolis , that helps us !
we can't waste time on nice uniforms and our pictures in the paper
the uniform i die in will be the uniform of the revolution !
look at that !
she looks like an angel !
yeah ! an angel !
around here there's two or three families to a room
there's no schools , hardly any jobs for people
they survive on food handouts , but with the ziggurat celebrations that's all been stopped
what does 'ziggurat' mean ?
it's an ancient babylonian tower
'the tower of babel' was one
you know what happened to that
the king's pride brought down the wrath of god on him
history repeats itself
the same thing will happen to duke red
but it won't be god this time it'll be us
is that wrong ?
no , it's fine
i was just thinking your hair's grown
what kind of hair do you like ?
huh ?
yours is fine right now
let's get back to your writing
next comes
'tima'
huh ? what ?
'tima'
my name
so you remember !
that's great !
now you'll start remembering more and more
thank you , ken-ichi
oh , i forgoti borrowed this from atlas
ken-ichi
so the army's with us ?
that helps a lot
the underground residents support us but they're not sure if we've got the strength to win or not
the malduks are to move when the ziggurat celebrations end
we want you to crush them and storm the ziggurat
the president will announce the arrest of duke red for treason
he will invoke his powers to take control of the police and military
then metropolis will be governed by the rule of law
and we will participate as a proper political party
of course , atlas
the president will welcome you with open arms
the things i get myself into !
i finally find that kid , and look what happens !
i'm sorry i could not have been of more assistance
what are you talking about ?
you've been lots of help ! i don't know east from west here
don't worry about ken-ichi
he's tougher than he
cut that out !
just look at this , will you ?
'watch out
hide , robots
coup d'état'
what ? ! a coup d'état ? !
take a good look , ken-ichi
tell the whole world how angry we are
i'm all out of breath !
we'd better get out of here , pero
we can't do anything
ask headquarters for back-up
i'm not leaving you here !
it's robots they're going to attack first !
i will be fine
what ? !
it is also my duty to ensure the safety of all visitors to our city
all right
just don't stir anything up till i get back !
are you going to hold this gate all by yourself ?
demonstrations are forbidden during celebration week
please disperse immediately
sorry , we can't do that
our time has come
why must humanity settle matters by resorting to violence ?
yes , we all know that
i agree it is a problem it's our emotions
they vibrate , and all we can do is move forward within that amplitude
but without affirming them , we can't survive
it's time for the uprising to begin
when should we release a statement ?
things should be clear by about 1 pm so i suggest 3 or 3 : 30
what is it , minister ?
hard to relax , eh ?
yes , mr president
i have an unpleasant duty to perform
what the ? !
you've gone over to duke red !
i am merely history's agent
wait ! we can discuss this !
why ?
why do humans just go and destroy robots ?
'revolution' !
the coup d'état has failed
martial law is in effect , under the command of duke red
abandon your weapons and surrender
i repeat the coup d'état has failed
martial law is in effect , under the command of duke red
abandon your weapons and surrender
ken-ichi !
hey ! ken-ichi !
uncle !
you're safe !
that's great !
are you all right ?
this ? it's nothing !
who's this ?
her name's tima
we escaped from that fire together
tima , this is my uncle
'uncle'
atlas !
itwasatrap !
we meet at last
don't move !
no trouble
give me the girl , and you might get back home alive
don't make promises you won't keep , rock !
don't play games with me !
tima ! pick up the gun !
i'll have that back , please
don't give it to him !
you going to shoot ?
i'm human , you know
rock !
so it's these people you've neglected your duties to go chasing after
it's you !
what's going on here ? !
you told me no one survived the fire in dr laughton's lab !
and how did you know about tima ?
answer me !
i will you are the one who must sit on the throne of power
no robot must ever rule the ziggurat , and metropolis !
fool !
'robot' ?
do you think you fool me ?
you're out of line , boy !
get up !
i never want to see you again !
so it was you who hired laughton !
what if i did ?
i've come from japan to arrest laughton
my name is shunsaku ban
get in
and ken-ichi ?
you'll see him later
i'm here to see superintendent notarlin
he's been transferred
his successor hasn't been named
there's been a mistake the malduks have taken my nephew away
handle it through your embassy !
at this moment our state extends its reach to the stars !
i tremble at the honor of announcing the culmination of humanity' long history of intellect and science
saké
make it hot
hot whisky or gin i can do , for a japanese detective
hot whisky , then
who gives a damn about the ziggurat ? !
and those malduks can eat dogshit !
here
hey ! that was rock !
i heard he quit the party
what's he doing here ?
thanks
take care
um a man earlier tonight asked me to give you this
i said 'no'
he wanted it kept secret from duke red , and of course i said i couldn't possibly , but his name was 'ken-ichi'
i can't move at the moment , so i can't come to you
'i' m leaving the country soon 'i want to see you again'
what's going on here ?
you will bring her back soon , won't you ?
i'll be in real trouble if they ever find out
don't worry
this won't take long
this wasn't my idea
i have to get back
you tricked me
how else could i talk to you ?
where's ken-ichi ?
if you know , take me to him
well , well , well
to talk to you , you'd never guess you were a robot
i guess father chose his mad scientist very well
what are you talking about ?
you being a robot
that's not true
i'm not a robot
so what are you ?
human ?
so who's your father ?
where is he ?
my father is ken-ichi
the super-being ? a mannequin like you ? !
if you can't take me to ken-ichi , i'm going
tima's gone ? !
watch where you're going !
let's see inside this super-being father wants so much
come on , laughton !
n-n-notebook
that notebook ?
don't be alarmed
i taught rock a lesson he won't forget
where's ken-ichi ?
i'm looking for him , too
i need your help for that
you do ?
i think they've got him somewhere in the ziggurat
i need to look for him on the ziggurat's data network
can you do that ?
hold out your hand
well ?
ken-ichi's in that building !
you did it !
i knew he was there !
what happened to me ?
i seeyou don't know who you are , do you
what do you mean ?
i'll report the instant we find anything , sir
duke red ?
anything ?
we can track the signal by where it burned out the splitters
got it !
where ?
zone 1 , south block 17 the hotel coconut
tell me , please !
am i human , or am i
well , you're different from normal robots
i'm human
just like ken-ichi !
uh , yesof course you are !
anyway , now we've got to rescue ken-ichi
tima ! i've been looking for you !
tell me what's going on , or i'll charge you with kidnapping !
i'm not your man
it's your son you want to talk to
i don't know what the plan is but i suspect dr laughton was involved in it somehow
and i suspect you had him killed to keep her a secret
take him away
come on !
that is a special throne made especially for you
one day from here you will rule the entire world !
me ?
why ?
that is your destiny
i'll show you
wake up , ken-ichi !
it's me !
can you hear me ?
what have you done to him ? !
he's in no danger
we just had to quiet him down a little
i'll file a protest with my embassy !
it'll be an international incident !
oh ?
i didn't realize you were so politically important
my apologies
but soon every nation in the world will bow down before tima
make ken-ichi the way he was
what's one or two young kids , tima ?
you have the power to rule the world !
what power is that ?
am i human ?
or am i one of those poor robots ?
oh , don't be silly !
you're nothing like those piles of junk !
then am i human , like ken-ichi ?
what are you saying ? !
you're no mere human being ruled by emotion and feeling , torn between morality and love !
you are the super-being !
so then i am a
i've brought you new clothes , miss tima
yes , you are a robot but you stand at the pinnacle of all existence !
no
i have the emotions and love that you hate
that's because your full capacities haven't yet taken form
as your abilities evolve they're simply taking the form of emotion and love
in time you will become one with that throne , a computer weapon meant on conquest !
your memories and emotions will all be erased !
how did you know that ? !
i fancy myself a detective
come , miss tima you should change
fatheropen your eyes !
what on earth ? !
what are you doing ? !
it is you who must sit on that throne
you are the leader we must bow to !
no !
you're awake ?
i am a humanoida machine made to destroy the world
not 'destroy' !
'make again' !
stop !
hey ! who threw that switch ? !
it just started up !
cut the power ! it won't respond !
it's going into the red !
dr ponkotz !
what's that alarm ? !
the omotanium generator's going wild !
what's going on ! ?
i'm not sure
stop , tima !
you'll destroy the ziggurat !
this comes of trifling with robots
her memory's merging with the data network !
thus god destroyed the tower of babel
no !
she's no longer the tima you knew !
all right
the omotanium generator will explode if we don't shut it down !
the chance of human survival will fall to 30 per cent within one hour
my entire world-wide network of forces will be completely activated within 30 minutes
their targets are the world's major cities and 7 , 586 other facilities
estimated time period for eradication of humanity by biological warfare : 17 hours , 27 minutes
hear that , duke red ?
your super-being says she doesn't need us !
come back !
doctor ! we've lost control of the underground power pl
what's happening ? !
get out !
you robots are not supposed to be here !
tima ! it's me !
ken-ichi !
it's ken-ichi !
stop !
the likes of you will never kill my father !
tima ! grab my hand !
i'm ken-ichi
who are you ?
'who are you'
no , no , noyou call yourself 'i'
grab on !
i amwho ?
where did you find this ?
fifi ?
fifi !
uncle !
uncle i think i'd like to stay here a bit longer
i amwho ?

early the next morning
hungry
" run along home ! "
" i live here "
" excuse me , my cane "
the tryout
" go ahead and be funny "
" that's awful ! "
" put on the william tell act "
" now then , watch this and see if you can do it "
" go ahead and try it "
" put on the barber-shop act "
" now i must hit you "
" now hit me ! "
" i can't see "
" just a moment ! "
" we haven't talked terms yet "
" get out and stay out ! "
" show's starting ! "
" aren't you coming in ? "
" you're not leaving ? "
" you see , we couldn't come to terms "
" thank you for the egg "
the show on
trouble with the property men
" how about our back pay ? "
" get to work ! "
" we quit ! "
" they've quit "
" get anybody ! "
" do you want a job ? "
" don't touch that button ! "
" he's a sensation , but he doesn't know it " " keep him on as a property man "
the circus prospered , but not the property man and the girl led the same hard life
" keep him busy and don't let him know he's the hit of the show "
a sick horse
" blow this pill down the horse's neck ! "
" the horse blew first -- "
" open the door , quick ! "
" i told you the lions were dangerous ! "
" where's that pill ? "
" come here ! "
" i've got to see a doctor ! "
" it's a shame the way they make you work -- " " and you the hit of the show "
" why of course ! "
" all the crowds , all the applause is just for you "
" i knew it ! "
" if you strike that girl , i'll quit ! "
" and what's more i want what i'm worth -- "
" i'll give you fifty dollars a week "
" sixty ! "
" i'll double it ! "
" nothing less than a hundred "
the next show
the success of the tramp made life easier for the girl and himself
" oh , merna , you must have your fortune told ! "
" i see love and marriage with a dark , handsome man who is near you now "
a new added attraction , rex , a tight-rope walker
" pardon me "
" go right ahead "
" i'll give you five dollars for it "
" it's happened ; i'm in love ! "
" he's a tight-rope walker " " i've just met him "
" hurry up , you're on ! "
the act over
" what's the matter ? "
" you hardly got a laugh ! "
" this is my friend "
" i don't like tight-rope walkers "
time brought many changes to the circus ;
new hopes and new ambitions
his new ambition
" never mind the rope " " you'd better try and be funny again or you'll go ! "
the next performance- and not a smile
" i've had enough of this ; " " you get one more chance "
" where's rex ? "
" rex , the tight-rope walker , hasn't shown up "
" is rex here ? "
" you can do the act , can't you ? "
" you'll do it or quit ! "
" i'll do it ; find his clothes ! "
" there's the clothes ! "
" you follow her ! "
" he'll kill himself "
" that's all right ; " " i've got him insured "
" take your time , there's another act to go on "
" why , what is the meaning of this ? "
" i am taking his place on the rope "
" you'll get killed "
" oh , no , i have a charmed life "
" i'll give you five dollars if you'll do it "
" not a word to anybody "
" please don't do this "
" you've forgotten your tights "
" you're on ! "
" you're through ! ! ! "
that night
" i've run away from the circus "
" i'll never go back "
" can't you take me with you ? "
" i've got an idea "
" you stay here "
" have you seen merna ? "
" she's run away -- "
" i can do nothing for her -- -- "
" now , there's one way out "
" she's there now ? "
" take me to her ! "
the next morning
the circus ready to leave
" so you've come back -- you -- ! "
" you're speaking to my wife ! "
" will you go on with the show ? "
" -- -- if you take him "
" the end wagon for you "
" come in with us "
we wanna see you , mr hammer
what's the matter ? somebody pay their bill ?
we want our money
yes , money
you want your money ?
we wanna get paid
oh , you want my money ?
is that fair ?
do i want your money ?
suppose george washington's soldiers had asked for money ? where would this country be today ?
but they did ask
and where's washington ?
no , my friends
no , money will never make you happy , and happy will never make you money
that might be a wisecrack , but i doubt it
we want our money
i'll make you all a promise
if you'll all stick with me and work hard , we'll forget about money
let's get together and we'll make a regular hotel out of this place
i'll put writing paper in the hotel , and next year if you behave yourselves , i'll put in envelopes
i'm gonna put extra blankets free in all your rooms
there'll be no cover charge
think of the opportunities here in florida
three years ago i came to florida without a nickel in my pocket
and now i've got a nickel in my pocket
that's all very well , mr hammer , but we haven't been paid in two weeks and we want our wages
wages ? do you wanna be wage slaves ?
answer me that
no
no , of course not well , what makes wage slaves ?
wages
i want you to be free
remember there's nothing like liberty , except colliers and the saturday evening post
be free , my friends
one for all and all for me , and me for you and three for five and six for a quarter
pardon me a couple of telegrams for you , mr hammer
there you are
business is beginning to pick up already
now if you gir boys will only be calm
uh-huh " we arrive this afternoon on the 4 : 30
kindly reserve two floors and three ceilings " they must be mice
" if we like your property , we will immediately buy it "
see that , things have started our way already
who's it from ?
western union , and they've got a lot of money too
on the 4 : 15 , eh ?
well , i'll take the bus down myself
here's another one , mr hammer
see , we're gonna be stuffed by tonight
this hotel will be so crowded that we'll be turning away thousands of people
" if there is another hotel in cocoanut beach , cancel our reservations "
i knew it
it was too good
wait a minute " ps
aunt fanny had an eight-pound boy
can you come to the wedding ? "
you see , everything is all right , boys everything is all right
you're all invited to the wedding of aunt fanny's eight-pound boy
hooray !
oh , but that won't be for a couple of years yet
in the meantime , i want you to buck up , get down to work
let's put this thing over with a bang
and above all , forget about money
don't think of it just forget about it , because you won't get it anyway
see that ?
i keep them dancing for their money
jamison , i'm going down to meet the 4 : 15
if i never come back , you'll know i'm still waiting for the train
yes , sir and in my absence , i'm relying on you to take good care of everything
you can depend upon me , sir
that's fine
if any guests come in , take good care of them
and think of me , jamison
you bet i will
i'll be back someday
all right keep a light burning in the window , if you can find a window
all right , sir good-bye
good-bye , jamison
hello , harvey
why so downhearted ?
is bob adams cutting you out with polly potter ?
i'm not worried about a hotel clerk
no , but i'll bet you're worried about the potter millions
you generally could use money in the old days
oh , lay off that stuff
you know , marrying polly is the only way for you to square your debts
i can take care of myself i doubt it
suppose i have a little plan that'll take care of both of us
what do you mean ? have you ever seen that diamond necklace of mrs potter's ?
you bet i have
what's that got to do with us ?
her room and my room are right next to each other
hers is 318 ; mine , 320
the door between is unlocked
well ? she keeps everything in a jewel case locked up in her dresser
the key is always in her bag
that's what you've got to get
it's a large order , but maybe it can be done
suppose i invite mrs potter and polly to take supper with me tonight ?
what then ?
sometime during the evening i might be able to get the key out of her bag
now you're talking
that sounds more like old times
and now i will try and get rid of bob adams for you
look , this is cocoanut manor
you know that hill ?
what a question do i know that cunning little hill ?
it's cunning , all right but that's why there hasn't been any development here
couldn't it be cut down ?
too expensive now , here's what happened
john w berryman was here to see it last month
you know , berryman practically built palm beach and miami , but he said he wouldn't touch this
now when a man like that passes a place up , no one wants it
do you know anything about architecture ?
no , but i'd love to learn
well , i made a drawing of the whole place showing the hills
it's a built-up scheme , without cutting down the hill or having it get in the way
i made the hill fit in with the architectural scheme
i sent berryman a copy last week , and his secretary wrote me a nice note saying they were studying my plans
that's thrilling
does mr hammer know about it ?
not yet
but if he takes it , i'll design the buildings
say , i may be an architect yet
if he only does , i'm sure it will be the most beautiful place in the world
it would be if you lived there
look , see what i've written ?
" heaven for polly and me "
that looks great
when do i move in ?
any day now
it's a lovely dream , bob
let's make it come true
the skies
will all be blue when my dreams
come true and i'll be smiling
through when my dreams
come true that spanish castle i built in my mind
will be a love nest
the practical kind and i'll be there
when my dreams
come true ever since i met you
all that i seem to do is dream
wonderful dreams
heaven's before my eyes
when will i realize my dreams
wonderful dreams
the skies
will all be blue when my dreams
come true and i'll be smiling through
when my dreams
come true that spanish castle
i built in my mind will be a love nest
the practical kind and i'll be there
when my dreams
come
will you look at that ?
i am looking
well , it's darn cute
i wonder who it can be
let's find out
then little red riding hood said to the wolf , " wolf , wolf , wolf , wolf "
hello how do you do , miss potter ?
hello hello
your mother is looking for you , polly
she generally is , and she generally finds me
you know mother
thanks a lot
it was a lovely story , mr adams
i'd like to hear the rest of it sometime
good-bye
i wonder if i could hear it sometime
with pleasure
how about you , yates ?
no , thanks
you know what happens to bad little boys who tell stories ?
certainly
they marry the beautiful princess
so long
and i'll be there
with you when my dreams
come
nice boy
the kind who usually gets what he wants
not always
i might win out yet
well , miracles do happen
well , polly , you've been out again with mr adams
but only for a little while , mother
why a daughter of mine should fool around with a hotel clerk when she has the opportunity of marrying one of the boston yates is more than i can understand ,
oh , who cares about the boston yates ?
anyway , bob isn't a clerk
he's an architect he's only clerking until he can get started
one who clerks , polly , is a clerk , and that settles it
and i want you to remember that no potter has ever been involved in a single scandal
how about uncle dick ?
polly , it's a well-known fact that your uncle was drunk at the time
and another thing , young lady , i'm quite tired of your sitting out on the beach all hours of the night hey hey
why don't you take something for that insomnia ? you ought to cut out drinking so much coffee
i'm sorry , sir
say , any luck with the 4 : 30 ?
yes , it didn't hit me that's the only luck i had with it
mr hammer , i think i know what's wrong with the hotel
i think i know too
you're fired get your hat and my coat and get out
maybe the season hasn't started yet
maybe the hotel hasn't opened yet
don't worry , mr hammer in a few weeks you'll be cleaning up
yes , and making the beds
go on , get out of here
i can handle this rush myself
600 rooms in the hotel and you have to sleep here
how do you do , mr hammer ?
why don't you whistle at the crossing ?
you're just the woman i'm looking for
now whether you like it or not , i'm gonna tell you about florida real estate
it's the first time it's ever been mentioned down here , today
i'm sorry , but do you know that property values have increased 1929 since 1 , 000% ?
do you know that this is the biggest development since sophie tucker ?
do you know that florida is the show spot of america and cocoanut beach is the black spot of florida ?
you told me about this yesterday
i know , but i left out a comma
look in a little while we're gonna hold an auction sale at cocoanut manor , the suburb terrible uh , beautiful
you must come over
there's gonna be entertainment , sandwiches and the auction
if you don't like auctions , we can play contract
here it is
cocoanut manor , 42 hours from times square by railroad
1 , 600 miles as the crow flies , 1 , 800 as the horseflies
there you are , cocoanut manor glorifying the american sewer and the florida sucker
why , it's the most exclusive residential district in florida
nobody lives there
and the climate ask me about the climate , i dare you
very well
how i'm glad you brought it up
our motto is , cocoanut beach no snow , no ice and no business
do you know that florida is the greatest state in the union ?
is it ?
take its climate no , we took that
take its fruits , take the alligator pears
take all the alligator pears and keep 'em
see if i care
do you know how alligator pears are made ?
haven't the slightest idea
that's because you've never been an alligator , and don't let it happen again
do you know that it sometimes requires years to bring the pear and the alligator together ?
they don't like each other
no
no do you know how many alligator pears are sent out of this state every year and told not to come back ?
i don't think i do
all they can get a hold of
florida feeds the nation , but nobody feeds me and that's what i wanna talk to you about
mr hammer another thing , take our cattle raising
i don't mean anything personal
but here is the ideal cattle raising section
we have longhorns , shorthorns and shoehorns
mr hammer , will you let me say something , please ?
i hardly think so , and there's something else i wanna bring to your mind
where will you be when you're 65 ?
that's only about three months from now
if i were to buy , i should prefer someplace like palm beach
palm beach ? the atlantic city of yesterday ?
the slums of tomorrow ?
do you know that the population of cocoanut beach has doubled in the past week ?
has it ? three bulldogs were born
we're expecting a nanny goat in the morning
i'm sorry , but i'm afraid i must be going
aw , now , don't go before you go , let me show you a sample of our sewer pipe we're gonna lay
look at it nobody could fool you on a sewer pipe , can they , a woman like you ?
now this is the eight-inch pipe
but of course , all property owners will be allowed to vote on the size of their pipe
in case of a tie , it goes to the supreme court , and i can give you a little inside information in advance
the chief justice is crazy about this type of sewer
here , put it in your pocket
i'll see you later
mr hammer , i can't use this
i don't want it
hello
yes ?
ice water in 318 ?
is that so ?
where'd you get it ?
oh , you want some ?
oh , that's different
have you got any ice ?
no , i haven't
this is cocoanut beach no snow , no ice
get some onions that'll make your eyes water
what ?
you too ! oh , mr hammer
mrs thompson wants to know if you'd reserve a table for dinner for her in a nice quiet spot

but it doesn't fit you i know
i had it made to order

maybe you got a good idea , eh ?
well , don't you dare come to room 320 at 11 : 00
all right , i come half past 10 : 00
did you see a handkerchief ?
i thought i dropped one
well , it really doesn't matter because what i'm really interested in is you
did anyone ever tell you that you looked like the prince of wales ? that's funny
i thought it was an original idea of mine
tell me , do you know who i am ?
do you know my room number ?
well , i'll be there at 11 : 00 tonight
did anyone ever tell you you look like the prince of wales ?
i don't mean the present prince of wales
one of the old wales and believe me , when i say wales , i mean wales
i know a whale when i see one
did you say your room was 318 ?
i'm the proprietor of this hotel and i have a passkey to every room in it
passkey ? passkey , that's russian for " pass "
you know they " passkey " down the " streetskey "
won't you , uh , lie down ?
aw , if we could find a little bungalow , eh ?
of course , i know we could find one , but maybe the people wouldn't get out
but if we could find a nice little empty bungalow just for me and you where we could bill and cow
no , where we could bull and cow
do you know what you're trying to say ?
yes , it's not what i'm thinking of
what i meant was , if we had a nice little bungalow and you was inside and i was outside trying to get in or inside trying to get out
no , i was in you was up
you were inside out and i was up
uh , no i'll tell you , if you don't hear from me by next friday , the whole thing's off
i don't think i understand
i mean , your eyes your eyes , they shine like the pants of a blue serge suit
what ?
that's an insult that's not a reflection on you that's on the pants
what i meant was if we had a nice bungalow and i came home from work and you were standing by the gate
no , you came home from work and i was standing by the gate
that's more like it
and we came down the path and we went inside and the shades were drawn and the lights were low , and , uh then , uh
are you sure your husband's dead ?
why , yes
there seems to be a trace of uncertainty in that " yes "
you know , a yes like that was once responsible for me jumping out of a window
and i'm not the jumper i used to be
what i meant was , you're gonna be here all winter and i'm stuck with the hotel anyhow , why don't you grab me until you can make other arrangements ?
my dear , mr hammer , i shall never get married before my daughter
you did once
oh , but i love you
i love you can't you see how i'm pining for you ?
what in the world is the matter with you ?
oh , i'm not myself tonight
i don't know who i am
one false move and i'm yours
i love you
i love you anyhow
i don't think you'd love me if i were poor
i might , but i'd keep my mouth shut
i'll not stay here any longer and be insulted this way
no , don't go away and leave me here alone
you stay here and i'll go away
i don't know what to say
say that you'll be truly mine , or truly yours or yours truly
don't you know that i'm
will you keep your hands to yourself !
come on i'll play you one more game
come on the three of you
can you come down a little bit ?
just think , tonight tonight when the moon is sneaking around the clouds , i'll be sneaking around you
i'll meet you tonight under the moon
oh , i can see you now you and the moon
you wear a necktie so i'll know you
send up some ice water right away
that's right
thank you
thank goodness
close the door
did you get the key ?
yes it's one of these
oh , that's fine
now , listen we can't take any chances on this job
how do you mean ?
there's bound to be trouble when she misses the necklace well ?
we can't have it found on us
i should say not
we've got to play it safe and hide it somewhere for a while
hide it ?
just for a few days
yes , but where ? anywhere but in here
hide it ? i know just the place
a hollow tree stump about a mile from here
will that do ?
fine , but how do i get there ?
it's cocoanut manor
you've been out there
i'm not so sure , harvey here , i'll show you
now , you you go right out cocoanut road
then there's augustine road , like this , but instead , you take the granada road
suddenly , you come to a clearing with a fringe of trees around it
that's cocoanut manor where the stump is
it's about 20 feet from the edge of the clearing
that's where you put the jewels
you can't miss it
now you take the necklace right out there , see ?
i've got to go back downstairs , or mrs potter will be suspicious
and be careful i will
cocoanut manor , granada road , 20 feet from the clearing
everything's going along swimmingly now
do you remember me ? the prince of wales ?
why , yes , of course i do
mr hammer , how dare you come into my room ?
if there's gonna be two people in this room , it'll be 50 cents extra did he go ?
who ?
anybody
get out
oh , prince , how you frightened me
this hotel not only has running water , it has running guests
do you remember me ?
prince of wales ? - who is it ?
